Difficulties Encountered
While working with the Netflix Shows dataset, several challenges were encountered:
1.	Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset included some missing values, especially in columns like director and cast. Handling these missing values was essential to ensure accurate analysis. This required careful inspection and cleaning of the data before performing any SQL queries.
2.	Parsing Date Fields: The date_added column was stored as a string in the CSV file. Converting this column to a proper date format in MySQL required additional steps. It was necessary to ensure that the dates were correctly parsed and stored to enable accurate date-based queries.
3.	Large Dataset Size: With over 6,000 entries, performing certain operations on the entire dataset was resource-intensive and time-consuming. This required optimizing queries to ensure they ran efficiently without consuming excessive computational resources.
